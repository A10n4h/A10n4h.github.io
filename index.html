<h1 style="color:LightGray;"> I am currently a freshmen at towers high school.My goal in life is to graduate high school on time and make it to college.
    When i grow up i wanna become a veterinarian.A veterinarian cares for the health of animanls.The reason i wanna be a veterinarian is because i love helping 
    animals.I have wanted to be a veternarian since i was in third grade.Helping animals is a joy that i love to do.Everyday you see a lot of homeless and 
    injured animals everyday.I want to help animals stay off the street and stay healthy.55 billion animals been killed and mudered every year.
    They have been losing their homes due to wild fires and trees being cut down.This causes them to flee into public neighborhood.
    I want to help to provide aid and keep animals out the streets abnd into there habitat.
